# 🧠 Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (Tkinter Edition)

This is a desktop GUI game based on the classic *“Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?”*, built using **Python 3.6** and **Tkinter**.  
It includes a full authentication system, trivia gameplay, score tracking, and persistent local storage — all bundled with a retro-inspired UI 🎮

> ⚠️ This is a legacy project from my early developer days (~2019). Not actively maintained, but kept for nostalgia.
